# Movie Recommender System (Jupyter Notebook, Python) October 2023 - December 2023
Developed a Movie Recommender System using Python, Streamlit, and an external API, TMDB. The recommendation engine utilizes a similarity matrix to suggest movies based on user-selected preferences

Created a user-friendly front-end interface with Streamlit, allowing users to select their preferred movie. Upon clicking the "Recommend" button, the system displays the top 5 recommended movies along with their posters

The system loads preprocessed movie data from pickled files and recommends movies based on user input, demonstrating proficiency in data handling and recommendation algorithms
